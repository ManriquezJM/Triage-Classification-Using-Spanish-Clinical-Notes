# Automated Triage Classification in Emergency Services Using Spanish Clinical Notes


---

## üìå Motivation
Triage in emergency departments often relies on nursing notes. Traditional methods are **subjective** and prone to **undertriage/overtriage**.  
Natural language processing (NLP) offers a path to more **accurate and consistent** triage support systems.  

Most prior work has focused on **English clinical text**.  
This study addresses that gap by focusing on **Spanish clinical notes** in a Chilean healthcare setting.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: Emergency department in Chile  
- **Triage categories**:  
  - **C1**: Vital emergency  
  - **C2**: Severe emergency  
  - **C3**: Moderate emergency  
  - **C4**: Minor emergency  
  - **C5**: Non-emergency  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Text standardization  
  - Domain-specific abbreviation dictionary  
  - Tokenization with **SentencePiece** (31k vocabulary)  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
Three experimental setups were evaluated:  

1. **Structured data only**  
   - Features: vital signs, age, blood pressure, etc.  
   - Models: CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP, Extra Trees, Logistic Regression  

2. **NLP with ALBERT**  
   - Input: Spanish clinical notes  
   - Approach: Fine-tuned ALBERT embeddings  

3. **Hybrid model**  
   - Combines structured features + ALBERT embeddings from notes  

**Data split**: 80/20 stratified sampling  
**Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, AUROC

## üèÜ Results
| Experiment | Accuracy | F1-score | AUROC |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Structured only | 59% | 56% | 0.88 |
| Clinical notes (ALBERT) | 75% | 74% | 0.89 |
| Hybrid (Structured + Notes) | **77%** | **76%** | **0.96** |

- **Best critical case detection (C2, C3): Hybrid + XGBoost**  
  - C2 ‚Üí Accuracy: 83%, F1: 83%  
  - C3 ‚Üí Accuracy: 77%, F1: 78%  

üîπ The AUROC of 0.96 exceeds the **0.91 average** reported in Matos (2024) for English-based models.
